## Implement Conflict Resolution

Configure appropriate conflict resolution policies for multi-region write scenarios. Without proper handling, data can be lost.

**Incorrect (ignoring conflicts):**

```csharp
// Using default LWW with _ts but not understanding implications
// Later timestamp wins - but "later" may be wrong server

// Server A clock: 10:00:00.100 → "shipped"
// Server B clock: 10:00:00.050 → "cancelled"
// Result: "shipped" wins even though B's write may be logically later
```

**Correct (explicit conflict resolution):**


```csharp
// Option 1: Last Writer Wins with logical clock (recommended)
var containerProperties = new ContainerProperties
{
    Id = "orders",
    PartitionKeyPath = "/customerId",
    ConflictResolutionPolicy = new ConflictResolutionPolicy
    {
```

```csharp
// Option 2: Stored procedure for custom resolution
var containerWithCustom = new ContainerProperties
{
    Id = "inventory",
    PartitionKeyPath = "/productId",
    ConflictResolutionPolicy = new ConflictResolutionPolicy
    {
```
